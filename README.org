Thesse are the soluations for folowing problems
   - Write a program to find the largest number in a list of numbers
   - Write a program to find the smallest number in a list of numbers
   - Write a program to find the largest and smallest numbers in a list of numbers
   - Write a function mean which will take a list of numbers of and find the mean of the list
   - Write a function median which will take a list of numbers of and find the median of the list
   - Write a function mode which will take a list of numbers of and find the mode of the list
   - Write a function called tables which takes two arguments m and
     n. It should print the m times tables from 1 to n.
     tables(3, 5) should print

     3 x 1 =  3
     3 x 2 =  6
     3 x 3 =  9
     3 x 4 = 12
     3 x 5 = 15

   - Write a function called tables2 which which takes one argument n
     and will print the tables from 1x1 to nxn in a square format
     e.g. tables2(5) will print

     1   2   3   4   5
     2   4   6   8  10
     3   6   9  12  15
     4   8  12  16  20
     5  10  15  20  25

     Bonus if you can print it like this

     1 |  2   3   4   5
     --+---------------
     2 |  4   6   8  10
     3 |  6   9  12  15
     4 |  8  12  16  20
     5 | 10  15  20  25

   - A sentence that contains all letters of the alphabet is a
     panagram. e.g. "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog",
     "sphinx of black quartz, judge my vow!"  Write a function called
     panagram which will take a string s as input and return True if s
     is a pangram and False if not

   - Write a function called freq which will take a string s as input
     and then return a dictionary d which contains the letters of s as
     keys and the number of times they occur as values. e.g. 
     freq("abbbcc") will return {'a' : 1, 'b' : 3, 'c' : 2}

   - Write a function called breakdown which takes a number n
     representing an amount of money as input and returns a breakdown
     of the amount in various denominations. e.g.
     breakdown(2722) will print
     1000 x 2 = 2000 (722 left)
      500 x 1 =  500 (222 left)
      100 x 2 =  200 ( 22 left)
       20 x 1 =   20 (  2 left)
        1 x 2 =    2 (  0 left)

     Use 1000, 500, 100, 50, 20, 10, 5, 1 as available denominations.
